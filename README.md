# prolbot-tweetd
first crack at building an automatic invite flow from twitter -> slack.  this is the twitter daemon part, which is going to be built on top of python-twitter [TODO add href, etc]


# DEV ENV REQUIREMENTS  
as in, if you want this to run on your localhost (or whatever), you'll need to install:

* python 3
* python package tool [`pip`](http://pypi.python.org)
* `virtualenv` - kind of like `nvm` (don't worry if you don't know what that means).  
UPSHOT - you get a python sandbox [RTFM](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
 
** pip is installable through homebrew (or apt-get, i'm sure). 
** and virtualenv is installable with pip.
